# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

This project is designed to predict breast cancer by classifying tumors as either malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. The project leverages a dataset of breast cancer cases and applies data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.

## Dataset
- **File Name**: `Breast_Cancer.csv`
- **Description**: The dataset contains features extracted from breast cancer cases, such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and other tumor characteristics.
- **Source**: [If the dataset is public, specify its source or provide a link.]

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
